Initial skeleton of a tuple reading program
Contains the definition of a simple flat-tuple - used by TupleMaker

Compile inside of RootCore to make the library needed by TupleMaker
Will also provide stand-alone Makefile needed to compile outside of RootCore for processing the simple flat tuple.

Still missing bits of functionality so won't do very much at present - but should compile.
